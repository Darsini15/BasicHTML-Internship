    <b>Importance of Literature</b> <br>

    <p1>The importance of literature is immense, what you learn will change your perception of the world and how you interact with people by using a wealth of literary devices such as tone, mood, and figurative language. <b>You will be able to share your ideas and thoughts in better ways through writing that conveys meaning clearly to your reader.</b> The best part is that you won’t even realize when you’ve started learning all these aspects. Reading literature will seep into your mind and work almost by osmosis!</p1>
